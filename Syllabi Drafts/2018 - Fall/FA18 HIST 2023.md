## About

This course will utilize history to better understand and interpret currents events in the United States. In particular, this course will focus on recent issues related to Native Americans and the American West. Over the course of the semester we will look at the historical roots of events such as the Dakota Access Pipeline protest on the Standing Rock Reservation, the shrinking of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments, and the on-going conflicts over the use of Native mascots in sports. 

## Readings/Materials

Two books required for the course are available for purchase at the OSU Student Union Bookstore and can also be purchased at various online sellers as well. Make sure you have purchased the correct edition.

- Winona LaDuke, *Recovering the Sacred: The Power of Naming and Claiming* (Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2016), paperback edition.
- David Treuer, *Rez Life: An Indian's Journey Through Reservation Life* (New York: Grove Press, 2012), paperback edition.

Additional materials related to the weekly lectures are posted on the course's BrightSpace page as PDFs.

## Assignments

**Movie Responses** - Over the course of the semester we will watch four movies/documentaries that deal with some of the issues covered in the lectures. In your responses you should discuss the purpose, topic, and thesis of the documentary along with any relevant historical context. In other words, why was the video made? What contribution does it make to the subject? Does it succeed or fail? You may also discuss anything that particularly stuck out to you in the video. Reviews should be between 500 and 750 words and need to be submitted to the appropriate Dropbox on the course's BrightSpace page. **Note**: Due dates for the reviews may shift depending on when we finish the videos to allow you adequate time to complete the assignments, any changes will be announced in class.

**Exams** - Two fifty minute, in-class exams, that will be comprised of short identifications of key terms and a longer essay. Each exam will cover one of the sections of the course.

**Essay Final** - Out of class essay that will utilize David Treuer's *Rez Life* and the material covered over the course of the semester to discuss and analyze issues facing Indigenous peoples in the United States today along with their historical roots. Further information and the prompt will be provided in November.

**Attendance** - Attendance is a critical component of succeeding through all levels of college. As such I will take attendance ten times randomly throughout the semester.

## Additional Policies

#### Drops

Important deadlines for dropping the class are:

- August 27: 100% refund for dropped class
- August 31: Partial refund for dropped class
- October 3: Six week grades
- November 9: Withdraw deadline

#### Incomplete Grades

University policy requires that students complete *at least 50%* of the assigned coursework to receive an "incomplete" grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive an "I" paired with the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B, I/C). **Incompletes are not automatic**, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.


#### Late Work

Students may turn in late work up to two days late for a 10% reduction in the grade per day. Late work will not be excepted after this point. Extensions will only be granted at my discretion and will only happen in extremely rare circumstances (i.e. serious illness, family emergency). In these circumstances you need to notify me as soon as you know. Accommodations will not be given if you fail to give me proper notice or do not provide adequate documentation. Students who will miss class for university related functions need to notify me as soon as they know to allow for the appropriate accomodations.

#### Class conduct

- Using computers for non-class activities will result in loss of laptop privileges. In the event laptops become enough of a distraction, they will be banned from use.
- Cellphones should be on silent and *in your backpack* not on your lap or desk.
- Do not pack up prior to the end of class. I lecture for the full fifty minutes, and some of the most important points in lectures come at the end as I'm wrapping up. Packing up early is not only disrespectful but causes too much noise for others to properly hear the lecture. 
- Taking photographs, videos, or audio recordings of the lectures or PowerPoint slides without my permission is prohibited.
- You are expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner. History has a number of controversial events and we will address some of these. Please respect the views of your classmates and treat everyone with decency. You will be asked to leave/lose attendance points if you are not able to conduct yourself in a professional manner.

#### Disability Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of his/her disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need special accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Disability Services, 315 Student Union, 405-744-7116. Please advise the instructor of such disability and desired accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first scheduled class period. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to www.okstate.edu/ucs/stdis/ for additional information.

#### Plagiarism/Academic Integrity

Intentional cheating of any kind on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges. For more information you may contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 101 Whitehurst, 405-744-5627, or visit http://academicintegrity.okstate.edu
