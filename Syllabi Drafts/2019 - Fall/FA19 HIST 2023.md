## What is "History of the Present?"

This course will utilize history to better understand and interpret currents events in the United States. In particular, this course will focus on recent issues related to Native Americans and the American West. Over the course of the semester we will look at the historical roots of events such environmental protests against oil pipelines, the shrinking of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments and changes to the Endangered Species Act, and the on-going conflicts over the use of Native mascots in sports.

#### Incomplete Grades

University policy requires that students complete *at least 50%* of the assigned coursework to receive an "incomplete" grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive an "I" paired with the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B, I/C). **Incompletes are not automatic**, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.

#### Late Work

Students may turn in late work up to two days late for a 10% reduction in the grade per day. Late work will not be excepted after this point. Extensions will only be granted at my discretion and will only happen in extremely rare circumstances (i.e. serious illness, family emergency). In these circumstances you need to notify me as soon as you know. Accommodations will not be given if you fail to give me proper notice or do not provide adequate documentation. Students who will miss class for university related functions need to notify me as soon as they know to allow for the appropriate accomodations.

#### Class conduct

- Laptops and other electronics may only be used with my approval. Students wishing to do so should see me in office hours or schedule an appointment
- Cellphones should be on silent and *in your backpack* not on your lap or desk.
- Do not pack up prior to the end of class. I lecture for the full fifty minutes, and some of the most important points in lectures come at the end as I'm wrapping up. Packing up early is not only disrespectful but causes too much noise for others to properly hear the lecture. 
- Taking photographs, videos, or audio recordings of the lectures or PowerPoint slides without my permission is prohibited.
- You are expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner. History has a number of controversial events and we will address some of these. Please respect the views of your classmates and treat everyone with decency. You will be asked to leave/lose attendance points if you are not able to conduct yourself in a professional manner.

#### Disability Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of his/her disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need special accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Disability Services, 315 Student Union, 405-744-7116. Please advise the instructor of such disability and desired accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first scheduled class period. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to www.okstate.edu/ucs/stdis/ for additional information.

#### Plagiarism/Academic Integrity

Intentional cheating of any kind on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges. For more information you may contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 101 Whitehurst, 405-744-5627, or visit http://academicintegrity.okstate.edu

# Movie Review Guidelines and Prompts

Writing the movie responses is more than simply summarizing the video, doing this will not lead to a good grade on the assignment. Instead you should focus on critiquing the video and analyzing both the arguments it makes as well as the background of the director and/or other relevant information that influences the construction of the documentary. To provide some basic starting points, here are some questions to consider when writing your reviews[^1]:

#### What is the main issue/topic of the documentary? Is it a political, social, or just informative piece? 

This is the first step to writing your review. Knowing whether the documentary is political, social, or informative will affect the specific details that you choose to discuss within your review as well as slightly alter your audience.

#### What is the context of this issue? Is this issue controversial? 

(Do research if necessary!) Context will help both you and your readers determine the significance and accuracy of the film based on the events at the time. Including context into your review will also allow readers to see that you are knowledgeable in your topic.

#### What is the history of the director of the film? 

There are some directors who are well-known for making especially biased pieces (i.e. Michael Moore) or who are well- acquainted with the subjects whom they are filming, which will give you an idea as to the bias of the film.

#### How accurate is the documentary? 

Using the context and the history of the director, you can find out what is accurate, inaccurate, or slightly skewed about the documentary. It is very important to inform your reader about this.

#### Which specific points in the film do you wish to analyze in detail? 

(These can include scenes, quotes, fluency of film, bias, use of imagery, use of music/sound, degree of interest, juxtaposition of shots, etc.) Of course, if you find more points later that you wish to add, you should do so, but first choosing a few points means that these should be highlighted since they immediately stood out to you.


# Style guidelines

- 500-750 words in double-spaced 12-point Times New Roman font
- All direct quotes and any material that is not common knowledge must be cited. Consult <https://bit.ly/HistChicagoStyle> for help on citing material in the correct footnote format. All citations do not count towards the word length.
