# Primary Source Responses

Directions: read the assigned documents, found within the "Readings from The Norton Mix" section of the electronic textbook. After reading all of the documents, respond with at least one direct quote per question from the primary source document(s) -- the introductory text at the start of each document does not count for a citation.

**Do not worry about the study questions included in your book – you should only respond to the two questions here. There are no make-ups, ensure you answer the appropriate questions below.**

## Additional Notes

- An exceptional primary source response will utilize material found in the corresponding main sections of the textbook in addition to the primary source material. Consult the course schedule or the table of contents for relevant material. **No outside sources are allowed**

- You need to show us you have not only read, but understand, the document you are responding to. Large blocks of quoted text and minimal analysis on your paper is not a sufficient response

- Students need to cite relevant page numbers from the textbook as necessary (e.g. when using quotes or citing non-common knowledge). For the primary sources you may use in-text citations (e.g. Foner, OSU-262 for primary source materials or Foner, 606 for the main part of the textbook). Ask your TA or Dr. Eberle for clarification on citations if you are not sure.

Submissions are to be submitted by 11:59PM for full credit
