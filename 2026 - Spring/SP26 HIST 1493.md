**Mandatory Reporting Notice**: All communications are kept confidential except in two circumstances. As University employees I (and the TAs) are required by law to report statements of self harm and sexual violence. Under Title IX I must inform the University of all reports of sexual violence regardless of circumstances or requests to not report. The University has confidential reporters who can assist you if you do not want the information reported to the University. Students who wish to take this option should contact the OSU victim advocates at 405-564-2129 or email advocate@okstate.edu.

## Notes on Contacting Us

Please ensure all emails include your full name, course information (date and time or five digit CRN), and relevant information on the issue. Emails without subjects, names, or course information are more difficult to address as I have two sections of 1493. 

Furthermore, this syllabus is your most basic reference source this semester. It provides answers to many of the questions you may have (exams, homework assignments, office hours, etc.) and you should consult this syllabus for answers prior to emailing.

The Foner textbook is required for the course.  **Please note**: The textbook is required for the course assignments and is only available as an ebook on Canvas, W.W. Norton did not produce a hard copy version.  Extensions or makeups will not be granted if you opt-out and lose access to the textbook.

Additionally, all students need to provide three blank full-sized blue books by the end of the second week of the course.

## Assignments

#### Syllabus Quiz

Short multiple choice quiz on Canvas that covers the basics of this syllabus. The quiz is pass/fail.

#### Attendance

Primary source responses (discussed below) will count as attendance in addition to the credit for the response itself. Attendance will only be excused for medical emergencies/illness with appropriate documentation. All requests for an excused absence must be made within five schools days of the absence.

#### In-Class Responses

8 in-class responses done throughout the semester. On response days you will have 10 minutes to write a response to the song or visual media that will be presented in class. Students who miss a response day can do up to four assignments in student hours for one week for full credit. After one week the assignment may not be completed for credit. Assignments may only be made up in scheduled student hours and not through appointments. Response days besides the first one will not be announced ahead of time.

**Please note**: Songs presented in class will be related to course materials and may include sensitive subjects and/or adult language.

#### Grade Disputes

Students wishing to dispute their grades (outside of obvious mathematical errors or clarification of comments) are required to wait 24 hours after the assignment has been handed back and then need to attend office hours (or schedule a meeting) **with the person who graded their work** to formally discuss the grade they received. Be prepared to come to the meeting with specific points you feel were not taken into account by your grader. If I did not grade your assignment I will only meet with you *after* you have talked to the TA. We reserve the right to raise *or* lower your grade at these meetings.

Final overall grades in the course are rounded to the nearest whole number only. 

Due to the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), we **do not** answer any emails related to grades. Emails about grades will not be answered, students unsure about where they stand in class need to come see us in person.

#### Drops

Important deadlines for dropping the class are:

- January 20 (Tuesday): 100% refund for dropped class
- January 23 (Friday): Partial refund for dropped class
- February 25 (Wednesday): Six Week Grades
- April 10 (Friday): Withdraw deadline

#### Incomplete Grades

University policy requires that students complete *at least 50%* of the assigned coursework to receive an "incomplete" grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B becomes a B, etc.) **Incompletes are not automatic**, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.

## Additional Policies

#### Late Work/Resubmissions

- Extensions are only available for illness or extenuating circumstances with appropriate documentation provided. All extension requests must be submitted in a timely manner.
- Exams do not have a late work window for completion. Exams may only be made up with appropriate documentation for extenuating circumstances and all makeups are at my discretion.
- Course absences due to scheduled events (e.g. field trips, sports absences, etc.) are not grounds for making up the assignment at a later date. If you know you are going to be absent for an event you need to either submit the assignment early or schedule a time to take the exam prior to the class period in which it is offered.

#### Extra Credit

There are **two extra credit opportunities in the course this semester**. First, students who turn in all assignments on-time this semester will receive 25 extra points at the end of the semester. Students with an approved extension request will still be eligible for the bonus points. Second, if 75% of the class completes the online course evaluation at the end of the semester, the entire class will receive 25 bonus points on the final exam. There are no additional opportunities for bonus points this semester.

#### Class conduct

- You must be in class for the entirety of the class period unless there is prior approval or an emergency. Students who arrive more than 5 minutes late or leave early will not be eligible for attendance on that day.
- Laptops are only allowed for note taking. Any non-class use will be subject to dismissal from class and loss of attendance points. Repeat violations will result in loss of technology privileges.
- Cellphones may not be used at any point during lecture and should be on silent and *in your backpack* not on your lap or desk, usage will result in dismissal from class and loss of attendance points.
- Taking photographs, videos, or audio recordings of the lectures or PowerPoint slides is strictly prohibited.
- Do not pack up prior to class being formally dismissed. Packing up early is not only disrespectful but causes too much noise for others to properly hear the lecture. 
- You are expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner. History has a number of controversial events and we will address some of these. Please respect the views of your classmates and treat everyone with decency. 

#### Accessibility Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of their disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Accessibility Services. Please advise the instructor of such disability and desired accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first scheduled class period. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to https://accessibility.okstate.edu for additional information.

**Students wishing to use SAS accommodations must see me in office hours to discuss their accommodations**

#### Plagiarism/Academic Integrity

Intentional cheating on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges. For more information you may contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 101 Whitehurst, 405-744-5627, or visit http://academicintegrity.okstate.edu

Specific course policies:

- All work must be your own original work this semester. You are not allowed to re-use or re-submit assignments from other courses or work with others on completing assignments.
- Outside sources are strictly prohibited in the course. You may only use the assigned course materials and lecture notes to complete assignments in the course.
- The use of artificial intelligence programs such as ChatGPT is strictly prohibited in the course.
