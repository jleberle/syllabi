## Assignments


#### *Devil in the White City* Paper

A short paper tackling some of the issues of the Gilded Age through the lenses of Erik Larson's popular history of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and a serial killer who attacked his victims during the event. Additional information and the prompt will be forthcoming shortly.

#### *March* Paper

A short paper analyzing the issues in the Civil Rights Movement utilizing the perspective of U.S. Congressman John Lewis's autobiographical graphic novel, *March*. Additional information on the paper and the prompt will be distributed later in the semester.

#### Exams

Two exams, taken in class on the date listed in the course schedule. The exams will be comprised of five short identifications and one essay question.

#### Final Exam

Hour and fifty minute exam that will have the same structure as the first two exams (five non-cumulative IDs and an essay) with the addition of a cumulative essay covering how specific themes influenced United States history. 

#### Attendance

I will take attendance 10 times randomly throughout the semester. Students who show up more than 10 minutes late to class or leave early without prior approval will not earn attendance points. I also reserve the right to withhold attendance points if you are on your phone, sleeping, or anything else that prevents you from being both physically and mentally present during lecture. Any issue disruptive to the learning process is classified as a class conduct violation and students who receive more than two class conduct violations will lose 25 points for each subsequent violation.

#### Grade Disputes

Students wishing to dispute their grades (outside of obvious mathematical errors or clarification of comments) are required to wait 24 hours after the assignment has been handed back and then need to attend office hours (or schedule a meeting) to formally discuss the grade they received. Be prepared to come to the meeting with specific points you feel were not taken into account in the grading. 

Due to the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), we **do not** answer any emails related to grades. Emails about grades will not be answered, students unsure about where they stand in class need to come see me in person

#### Drops

Important deadlines for dropping the class are:

- January 22: 100% refund for dropped class
- January 25: Partial refund for dropped class
- February 27: Six week grades
- April 12: Withdraw deadline

#### Incomplete Grades

University policy requires that students complete *at least 50%* of the assigned coursework to receive an "incomplete" grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B becomes a B, etc.) **Incompletes are not automatic**, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.

## Additional Policies

#### Late Work

You may only turn in work for 48 hours after the assignment is due, with a 10% grade reduction per day. Any work submitted after this point will not be accepted. Extensions for full credit will only be granted in extremely rare circumstances (i.e. serious illness, family emergency) with the appropriate documentation.

Absences that are scheduled ahead of time are not a reason for an extension, students missing class for scheduled reasons need to complete the work ahead of time or schedule an alternative exam time prior to the missed class session. Failure to notify me of conflicts in a timely manner will result penalties for late work.

Class Powerpoints and notes are not posted online. It is the responsibility of students who miss class to secure the appropriate notes from someone in class or attend in-person office hours to discuss what was missed in class. 

#### Extra Credit / Resubmissions

No extra credit assignments will be offered this semester. Additionally students may not re-do assignments for additional points. All grades are final once submitted.

#### Class conduct

- Laptops may only be used with my permission. Students wishing to utilize laptops need to attend office hours or schedule an appointment to discuss the matter.
- Cellphones must be on silent and *in your backpack* not on your lap or desk. 
- Do not pack up prior to class being formally dismissed. Packing up early is not only disrespectful but causes too much noise for others to properly hear the lecture. 
- Taking photographs, videos, or audio recordings of the lectures or PowerPoint slides is prohibited.
- You are expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner. History has a number of controversial events and we will address some of these. Please respect the views of your classmates and treat everyone with decency. You will be asked to leave/lose attendance points if you are not able to conduct yourself in a professional manner.

#### Disability Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of his/her disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need special accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Disability Services, 315 Student Union, 405-744-7116. Please advise the instructor of such disability and desired accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first scheduled class period. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to www.okstate.edu/ucs/stdis/ for additional information.

**NOTE**: Students with SDS accommodations need to either attend office hours or schedule an appointment to discuss the accommodations before the end of the second week of classes.

#### Plagiarism/Academic Integrity

Intentional cheating of any kind on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges. For more information you may contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 101 Whitehurst, 405-744-5627, or visit http://academicintegrity.okstate.edu
