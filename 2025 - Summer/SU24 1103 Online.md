**Mandatory Reporting Notice**: All communications are kept confidential except in two circumstances. As a University employee I am required by law to report statements of self harm and sexual violence. Under Title IX I must inform the University of all reports of sexual violence regardless of circumstances or requests to not report. The University has confidential reporters who can assist you if you do not want the information reported to the University. Students who wish to take this option should contact the OSU victim advocates at 405-564-2129 or email advocate@okstate.edu.

# Course Description

This course provides a general introduction to major themes and events in the history of North America and the United States beginning with early European-indigenous encounters and continuing through the present day. Students are expected to attend weekly lectures, complete assigned readings, and demonstrate acquired knowledge through exams and an essay assignment. Students are also expected to think critically about the complicated, and possibly controversial, nature of our nation’s shared pasts.

## A Note About Online Delivery

This course is delivered entirely online and asynchronously. Because this course does not meet in person it is expected that your work on the course each week will equal the time you would have spent in a traditional face-to-face class. Over the course of the semester you will need to cover roughly three to four chapters in the assigned textbook per week and complete the associated assignments. 

Additionally, you must have access to reliable internet throughout the semester. Make sure you do not wait until the last minute to submit assignments as technical issues (e.g. internet outages, technical errors) are not grounds for extensions as they cannot be sufficiently verified. 

I encourage you to contact me as soon as possible if you are having trouble comprehending the material or find yourself falling behind or getting overwhelmed. I am also available to discuss constructing essays/planning for your exams.

# Required Materials 

Eric Foner, *Give Me Liberty* Custom OSU Edition

This book is only available as an e-book on the Canvas course, there are not hard copy versions available from the publisher. It is required to complete the class assignments and failure to have access to the e-book is not grounds for an extension on assignments.

The two exams in the course will be completed with the ProctorU online proctoring service. Each exam will cost $8-$12 depending on when the exam is scheduled, more information can be found [here](https://itle.okstate.edu/online-test-proctoring.html). Further information will be available prior to exam week.

# Assignments

**Syllabus Quiz** - Short multiple-choice quiz to check your reading and understanding of the syllabus and intro video. Assignment is pass/fail.

**Course Engagement** - Grade will be based on viewership of course lecture videos. Canvas records the amount of time you spend on individual videos and points will be awarded for each video completed in full.

**Inquisitive Quizzes** - Each week will you complete quizzes connected to the course's assigned textbook chapters. Exam weeks will not have inquisitive assignments but the material covered those weeks will appear on the exam. Three lowest scores will be dropped from your grade.

**Exams** - Two exams, a midterm and final exam, that will consist of short answer responses and a formal essay responding to a prompt. On each exam you will be asked to identify five terms in a paragraph-length response each that provides the relevant information on the topic as it relates to the class material and write a minimum 500 word essay responding to an essay prompt. Essays should be well organized and reference specifics  from the assigned course materials. Each exam will be completed on Canvas with a time limit of 75 minutes

**Extra Credit** - The course does not have extra credit opportunities this semester and assignments may not be revised or resubmitted for additional credit once they are graded.

## Grading Policies

- All assignment submissions are final once the due date has passed and it is the responsibility of students to verify the correct assignment was submitted to Canvas and that assignments are not corrupted. Wrongly submitted assignments are not grounds for resubmission.
- Once assignments have closed on Canvas they cannot be completed for credit except in extenuating circumstances (unforeseen illness, etc.) and you need to alert me as soon as possible and provide relevant dated documentation of the issue. Extensions will not be granted without documentation.
- Due to federal privacy laws, grades cannot be discussed over email or via Canvas assignment comments. Students wishing to discuss their grade in the course must schedule an office hours appointment with me. 

## Incomplete Grades

Incomplete Grades University policy requires that students complete at least 50% of the assigned coursework to receive an “incomplete” grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive an “I” paired with the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B, I/C). Incompletes are not automatic, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.

# Accessibility Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of their disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need special accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Accessibility Services, Oklahoma ABLE Tech & Student Accessibility Services 1514 W. Hall of Fame, 405-744-7116. Please advise the instructor of such disability and desired accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first scheduled class period. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to https://accessibility.okstate.edu for additional information.

**Students wishing to use SAS accommodations need to schedule a meeting with me as soon as possible**

# Academic Integrity

Plagiarism/Academic Integrity Intentional cheating of any kind on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges.
