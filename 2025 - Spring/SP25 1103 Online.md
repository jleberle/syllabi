# Course Description

This course provides a general introduction to major themes and events in the history of North America and the United States beginning with early European-indigenous encounters and continuing through the present day. Students are expected to attend weekly lectures, complete assigned readings, and demonstrate acquired knowledge through exams and an essay assignment. Students are also expected to think critically about the complicated, and possibly controversial, nature of our nation’s shared pasts.

## A Note About Online Delivery

This course is delivered entirely online and is largely self-paced over the course of the week. Because this course does not meet in person it is expected that your work on the course each week will equal the time you would have spent in a traditional face-to-face class. Over the course of the semester you will need to cover roughly two chapters in the assigned textbook per week and complete the associated reading quizzes or primary source document assignments to keep a reasonable pace. 

I encourage you to utilize my office hours throughout the semester, especially if you are having trouble comprehending the material or find yourself falling behind or getting overwhelmed. I can review drafts of the primary source assignments or discuss materials for the exams, but only prior to the exams opening. I am not able to answer content related questions on the exams while they're open for completion.

# Course Materials and Costs

Eric Foner, *Give Me Liberty* Custom OSU Edition, delivered electronically through the Canvas site.

**Note**: The Foner textbook is mandatory for the course and there is not an alternative form of delivery as Norton has not produced a hard copy of the custom OSU edition. Failure to have access to the textbook is not grounds for extensions on assignments.

The textbook is the only resource besides lectures that you're allowed to use in completing assignments for the course. **Use of outside sources will result in automatic failure on assignments**. Outside source usage is anything not provided through the course materials. Students who use un-cited outside materials may be subject to academic integrity hearings.

## Meazure/ProctorU Monitoring 

In this course, all exams will be proctored by a third-party vendor, Meazure Learning/ProctorU.  For this course, you will be using Record+. A week before the exam, please go to the Student Guide to Taking a Test and complete the steps to ensure that your device is able to be used for online proctoring and that you understand the online proctoring process. The online test proctoring cost of $6 per exam will be billed to your Bursar account early the next month after each exam.

# Assignments

**Syllabus Quiz** - Ten question, pass/fail quiz covering the syllabus and course policies.

On each exam you will be asked to identify five terms in a paragraph-length response each that provides the relevant information on the topic as it relates to the class material and write a comprehensive essay related to the material from that section. Exams may be scheduled at any point during the week throught ProctorU/Meazure with the last exam slot being 9:45PM on Sunday.

## Grading Policies

- All assignment submissions are final. No resubmissions will be accepted. 
- The only extra credit opportunity is if 75% of the course submits course evaluations at the end of the semester. No additional extra credit is offered in the course and students may not submit additional work or revise assignments for additional credit at any point during the semester.
- Once assignments have closed on Canvas they cannot be completed for credit. Technical issues cannot be verified by myself or Canvas support and are not valid excuses for missing assignments. If you have technical issues you should contact Canvas support as soon as possible prior to the deadline to resolve any issues.
- If you have a extenuating circumstance that prevents you from completing course assignments (unforeseen illness, etc.) you need to alert me as soon as possible and provide relevant dated documentation of the issue. Extension requests without appropriate documentation will not be approved.

## Incomplete Grades

Incomplete Grades University policy requires that students complete at least 50% of the assigned coursework to receive an “incomplete” grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive an “I” paired with the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B, I/C). Incompletes are not automatic, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.

# Accessibility Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of their disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need special accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Accessibility Services, 315 Student Union, 405-744-7116. 

Please schedule an office hours appointment during the first week of the semester if you wish to utilize your accommodations. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to https://accessibility.okstate.edu for additional information.

**Students utilizing accommodations must attend office hours during the first week of classes (or immediately after receiving approval for accommodations) to discuss accommodations**

# Academic Integrity

Plagiarism/Academic Integrity Intentional cheating of any kind on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges. For more information you may contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 101 Whitehurst, 405-744-5627, or visit http://academicintegrity.okstate.edu

All assignments must be your own independent work. Collaboration on assignments is prohibited and collaboration can result in point deductions or academic integrity issues for both parties. Use of artificial intelligence or similar programs to complete course assignments is strictly prohibited.
