**Mandatory Reporting Notice**: All communications are kept confidential except in two circumstances. As University employees I (and the TAs) are required by law to report statements of self harm and sexual violence. Under Title IX I must inform the University of all reports of sexual violence regardless of circumstances or requests to not report. The University has confidential reporters who can assist you if you do not want the information reported to the University. Students who wish to take this option should contact the OSU victim advocates at 405-564-2129 or email advocate@okstate.edu.

#### Grade Disputes

Students wishing to dispute their grades (outside of obvious mathematical errors or clarification of comments) are required to wait 24 hours after the assignment has been handed back and then need to attend office hours (or schedule a meeting) **with the person who graded their work** to formally discuss the grade they received. Be prepared to come to the meeting with specific points you feel were not taken into account by your grader. If I did not grade your assignment I will only meet with you *after* you have talked to the TA. We reserve the right to raise *or* lower your grade at these meetings.

Due to the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), we **do not** answer any emails related to grades. Emails about grades will not be answered, students unsure about where they stand in class need to come see us in person.

#### Drops

Important deadlines for dropping the class are:

- January 21 (Tuesday): 100% refund for dropped class
- January 24 (Friday): Partial refund for dropped class
- February 26 (Wednesday): Six Week Grades
- April 11 (Friday): Withdraw deadline

#### Incomplete Grades

University policy requires that students complete *at least 50%* of the assigned coursework to receive an "incomplete" grade. While I will only give incompletes in extremely rare situations, be advised you will need to finish the coursework within a year to remove the incomplete, otherwise you will receive the grade you earned at that time (e.g. I/B becomes a B, etc.) **Incompletes are not automatic**, you need to meet with me in person to arrange an incomplete.

## Additional Policies

#### Late Work/Resubmissions

- All out of class assignments are due to Canvas by 11:59PM on the date listed in the syllabus. After the deadline you have 48 hours to submit the assignment for late work credit with 10% off per day late.
- Extensions are only available for illness or extenuating circumstances with appropriate documentation provided. All extension requests must be submitted in a timely manner.
- Exams do not have a late work window for completion. Exams may only be made up with appropriate documentation for extenuating circumstances and all makeups are at my discretion.
- Course absences due to scheduled events (e.g. field trips, sports absences, etc.) are not grounds for making up the assignment at a later date. If you know you are going to be absent for an event you need to either submit the assignment early or schedule a time to take the exam prior to the class period in which it is offered.
- Technical issues do not qualify for extensions on assignments. If you run into a technical issue prior to the deadline, email Dr. Eberle a copy of the assignment as an email attachment *prior to the deadline*, links to Google Docs or other online services will not be accepted.
- Assignments may not be resubmitted or revised for additional credit after the assignment deadline has passed. Make sure to verify your submission to Canvas is both the correct assignment and displaying correctly. Wrongly submitted assignments are not grounds for resubmissions.

#### Extra Credit

There are **two extra credit opportunities in the course this semester**. First, students who turn in all assignments on-time this semester will receive 25 extra points at the end of the semester. Students with an approved extension request will still be eligible for the bonus points. Second, if 75% of the class completes the online course evaluation at the end of the semester, the entire class will receive 25 bonus points on the final exam. There are no additional opportunities for bonus points this semester.

#### Class conduct

- Laptops are only allowed for note taking. Any non-class use will be subject to dismissal from class and loss of attendance points. 
- Cellphones may not be used at any point during lecture and should be on silent and *in your backpack* not on your lap or desk, usage will result in dismissal from class and loss of attendance points.
- Taking photographs, videos, or audio recordings of the lectures or PowerPoint slides is strictly prohibited.
- Do not pack up prior to class being formally dismissed. Packing up early is not only disrespectful but causes too much noise for others to properly hear the lecture. 
- You are expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner. History has a number of controversial events and we will address some of these. Please respect the views of your classmates and treat everyone with decency. 

#### Accessibility Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, each student with a disability is responsible for notifying the University of their disability and requesting accommodations. If you think you have a qualified disability and need accommodations, you should notify the instructor and request verification of eligibility for accommodations from Student Accessibility Services. Please advise the instructor of such disability and desired accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first scheduled class period. Faculty members are obligated to respond when they receive official notice of a disability, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations. To receive services, you must submit appropriate documentation and complete an intake process during which the existence of a qualified disability is verified and reasonable accommodations are identified. Go to https://accessibility.okstate.edu for additional information.

**Students wishing to use SAS accommodations must see me in office hours to discuss their accommodations**

#### Plagiarism/Academic Integrity

Intentional cheating on any assignment will result in formal academic integrity violation proceedings including referral to the Office of Student Conduct, and may result in a failing grade for the entire course and/or receiving a permanent notation of a violation of academic integrity on your transcript (F!) All students should be familiar with university academic integrity guidelines and procedures, including the right to appeal charges. For more information you may contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 101 Whitehurst, 405-744-5627, or visit http://academicintegrity.okstate.edu

Specific course policies:

- All work must be your own original work this semester. You are not allowed to re-use or re-submit assignments from other courses or work with others on completing assignments.
- Outside sources are strictly prohibited in the course. You may only use the assigned course materials and lecture notes to complete assignments in the course.
- The use of artificial intelligence programs such as ChatGPT is strictly prohibited in the course.
